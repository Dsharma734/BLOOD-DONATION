<h2><center>Importance of Blood Donation</center></h2>

Blood donation is one of the most significant contribution that a person can make towards the society. It is not harmful for an adult person to donate blood. The body of the donor can regenerate the blood within few days. It poses no threat to the metabolism of the body.<br><br>

The World Blood Donor Day is observed on 14th June every year.<br><br>

An ailing body needs blood for various reasons. He may be attacked with anemia, undergone an operation or may meet with an accident. But such a patient may die for want of blood as it is not always available. Even a pregnant mother may need blood in case of emergency situation.<br><br>

The patient needs blood or his or her group of blood whenever necessary. It is another important thing. Blood has four groups namely, A. B, AB and O. The required group must be the same while transplanting otherwise the transplantation will go in vain and even the patient may die. The man with the O-group blood is called the universal donor as the people having others can accept it. On the contrary, the man with AB group of blood is called the universal receiver as he can accept all groups of blood.<br><br>

Blood can be stored for a limited period of time that is why the blood banks need a steady and constant collection.<br><br>

Nowadays a public awareness is noticed to donate blood. Many clubs, colleges, societies, offices, etc. organize blood donation camps on different occasions. It is a healthy gesture. We must keep this aptitude up at any cost. Our blood banks are running short of required blood. By organizing such blood donation camps we may help them to enrich their capacity.<br><br>

However, it is very important that while taking blood from a certain person the concerned authority must make sure the the blood is not infected.<br><br>

Blood donation is our human duty. Our body does not get affected if we donate blood. The body can repair the loss within a few days. So we must come forward to donate blood as it can make sure the return of a dying man again into the light of life.<br>
